<p> As stated in my homepage I am from Springfield, Illinois. But originally I grew up in Connecticut until about halfway through  highschool I moved to the midwest. In my family I am the only boy with 3 sisters. Having only sisters definitely has its ups and downs. Some pro's to having sisters is they are typically more fashion skilled so they were always able to help me look my best when needed. As well as in relationships they taught me some things that girls liked and didn't. A few con's to sisters is that they typically didn't have to help out too much when outdoor chores were to be done. Also they always were more easily irritated with some actions that a brother would find funny. </p1>
