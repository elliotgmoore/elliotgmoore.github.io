<p> Throughout high school I played lacrosse as my primary sport and I found it to be my favorite activity in the spring time. When I moved to Illinois they didn't have highschool lacrosse so I had to play on a town team which was made up of a lot of younger kids and less skilled players. So I found myself as a way to teach this team to be better players and became team captain to display some of the practice methods and drills that I learned in the better east coast lacross programs. </p>
