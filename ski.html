<p> I really enjoy skiing and basically all outdoor action. I started skiing when I was about 5 years old and ever since then, I haven't stopped. My dad was the person to get me into skiing and I'm glad he did because it is just such a great time. If there was one thing I would love to do all the time and not worry about money or time or anything it would be skiing.
