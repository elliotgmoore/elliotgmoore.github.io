<p> Fishing to me is one of the very best methods of relaxation and satisfaction. Relaxing in the sun on a boat with a couple friends kicked back waiting for the fish to bite are some of my best summer memories. It really builds up your patience because sometimes you'll be sitting out on the water for a while. I caught my first bass when I first started fishing around 12 years old. I can vividly remember that day and how excited I was. It is an unreal feeling of accomplishment and success.
